# LP2024
By Hsu, Gee-Sern and Chen, Jiun-Chang and Chung, Yu-Zu

LP-2024 dataset offers 33,240 labeled license plates in 17,789 images. The images were taken at different time of the day, under various traffic and weather conditions, and by using different types of cameras. The size of LPs varies from as small as 32 (8x4) pixels to 66,138 (438x151) pixels.

Shooting takes place as following:
- **Time Period** refers to shooting activities that encompass both day and night.
- **Orientation** refers to the shooting angle, with **yaw**, **pitch**, and **roll** represented as **(80°/50°/30°)**.
- **Weather** refers to shooting under the following conditions: sunny, rainy and cloudy days. 

More detailed introduction of LP2024 can be found in the [paper]().
